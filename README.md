# TileMapper

## Overview

A drag and drop interface to associate tiles with their bitmask value. The tilemap expects a map file with discreet values to be loaded into the map section, and an image with tiles to be loaded into the texture section. Once both items are loaded, set the tile width, height and scale to properly subdivide your textures. Next drag and drop the textures onto their numbers until the mapping looks correct. The associated data will be avaible below for export.
